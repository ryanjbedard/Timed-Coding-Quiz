# Timed-Coding-Quiz

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to build a timed coding quiz that would display multiple choice questions for the user to answer. They would be penalized 10 seconds from the timer for each incorrect answer and their high score would be logged at the end of the quiz. I learned about the intricicies of using web API to call ids, classes, and really any section of the web pages using JavaScript to manipulate the page in different ways.
